EEP!

Remember how on old Macs you could set the clock to emit a random sound at certain intervals? Hate how Apple removed that feature? I brought it back.

# Install
1. `git clone` this repo or download the ZIP file
2. Go into the folder and do `./install.sh`
3. Now your computer will play a random sound at the top of every hour, from 9 AM to 5 PM.
4. EEP!
